# Dagens Arbete - 2025-07-05 (Schema Separation Fix)

## Critical Database Schema Issue - FIXED

### Problem Discovered
- User accidentally reset the Neon database with `prisma db push --force-reset`
- Investigation revealed a fundamental architecture problem:
  - Both central (Neon) and orchestra (Supabase) databases were using the same schema
  - This created all 25 tables in both database types
  - Central database had orchestra-specific tables that shouldn't exist there

### Root Cause
- Single `schema.prisma` file used for all databases
- When migrations run, it creates ALL tables regardless of database purpose
- Violates the intended architecture of separated concerns

### Fix Implemented

#### 1. Database Recovery
- Created `scripts/restore-neon-data.ts` to restore from backup
- Restored 2 orchestras (SCO, SCOSO) and 3 users
- All login credentials and database URLs restored

#### 2. Schema Separation
- Created `prisma/schema.central.prisma` - Only 4 tables for superadmin
- Created `prisma/schema.orchestra.prisma` - 21 tables for orchestra data
- Different output directories to prevent conflicts

#### 3. Database Cleanup
- Created `scripts/clean-neon-database.ts`
- Dropped 21 orchestra-specific tables from Neon
- Neon now only has: Orchestra, User, Customer, SystemLog

#### 4. Verification
- Created `scripts/verify-orchestra-databases.ts`
- Confirmed SCO has 163 musicians, 45 projects
- Confirmed SCOSO has 5 musicians, 7 projects
- Both orchestra databases completely intact

### Impact
- **No data loss** in orchestra databases
- **Central database restored** with correct structure
- **Architecture now correct** with proper separation
- **Future migrations** will use correct schemas

### Documentation Created
- `DATABASE_SCHEMA_SEPARATION.md` - Complete guide on the fix
- Updated daily work logs
- Created recovery and verification scripts

### Next Steps
1. Update all code imports to use correct Prisma clients
2. Update deployment scripts to use separate schemas
3. Create automated tests to verify schema separation
4. Add validation to prevent wrong tables in databases

### Lessons Learned
1. **Always use separate schemas** for different database purposes
2. **Never share schemas** between central and tenant databases
3. **Create verification scripts** to catch architecture violations
4. **Document the intended architecture** clearly

### Time Spent
- Investigation: 30 minutes
- Recovery implementation: 45 minutes
- Verification and documentation: 30 minutes
- Total: ~2 hours

### Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Database architecture correctly separated
