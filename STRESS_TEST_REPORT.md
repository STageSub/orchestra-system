   - Implement alerts for business rule violations
   - Add automated conflict detection in production
   - Monitor response rates and timeout patterns

### Long-term Improvements

3. **Expand Test Coverage** (Low Priority)
   - Add timeout simulation tests
   - Include email delivery verification
   - Test under higher load scenarios

4. **Performance Optimization** (Low Priority)
   - Consider query optimization for large datasets
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
