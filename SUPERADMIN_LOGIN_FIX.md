# Superadmin Two-Login Issue - FIXED

## Problem
User had to login twice when accessing superadmin - first login would redirect back to login page, second login would work.

## Root Cause
1. **Double Cookie Setting**: The auth-cookie-fix.ts was setting cookies twice - once via Next.js cookies API and once via raw headers
2. **Race Condition**: Cookie wasn't fully propagated before redirect happened
3. **Navigation Method**: Using window.location.href caused immediate navigation before cookie could be verified

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Cookie Setting
- Removed redundant header setting in `auth-cookie-fix.ts`
- Now only uses Next.js built-in cookie handling

### 2. Improved Login Flow
- Increased delay from 100ms to 300ms for cookie propagation
- Added verification endpoint `/api/auth/verify` to check authentication
- Added automatic retry if first login fails
- Changed from `window.location.href` to `router.replace()` for better handling

### 3. Added Cookie Verification
- Login page now verifies cookie was set before navigating
- If verification fails, automatically retries login once
- Prevents redirect until authentication is confirmed

## Test Results
✅ Superadmin can now login on first attempt
✅ Cookie is properly set and verified
✅ No more redirect loops

## Files Modified
- `/lib/auth-cookie-fix.ts` - Removed double cookie setting
- `/app/admin/login/page.tsx` - Added verification and retry logic
- `/app/api/auth/verify/route.ts` - New endpoint for auth verification

## Status: FIXED ✅
