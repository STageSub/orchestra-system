# Custom Ranking List UI/UX Fixes - 2025-07-04

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Button Overflow Issue
- **Problem**: "Ändra befintlig lista" button text extended beyond modal boundary
- **Solution**: 
  - Shortened button text to "Ändra lista"
  - Added `flex-shrink-0` class to prevent wrapping
  - Added `title` attribute for full text on hover

### 2. ✅ Dropdown Organization
- **Problem**: Dropdown became very long with many lists, hard to distinguish custom from standard lists
- **Solution**: 
  - Organized lists into optgroups: "Standardlistor" and "Anpassade listor"
  - Standard lists show as "A-lista", "B-lista", "C-lista" with descriptions
  - Custom lists show with their full name (V.XX format)
  - Clear visual separation between list types

### 3. ✅ Custom List Labeling
- **Problem**: Custom lists showed as generic "C-lista" causing confusion
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed `listType` for custom lists from 'custom' to 'Anpassad'
  - Custom lists now display their actual name instead of generic label
  - Properly calculates active musician count for custom lists

### 4. ✅ Week Number Format Enforcement
- **Problem**: List names should always include "V.XX" prefix
- **Solution**: 
  - In edit mode: V.XX shown as non-editable prefix, user can only edit description
  - New lists automatically get "V. [weekNumber] [projectName]" format
  - Consistent formatting across all custom lists

### 5. ✅ List Refresh After Save
- **Problem**: After saving custom list, dropdown showed "0 listor" despite successful save
- **Solution**: 
  - Made `fetchRankingLists` return a promise
  - Await the refresh before updating state
  - Added delay to ensure proper state update
  - Update `existingCustomListForPosition` after creation

### 6. ✅ Custom List Selection
- **Problem**: Selecting a custom list from dropdown didn't show it as selected
- **Solution**: 
  - Added logic to detect when a custom list is selected
  - Automatically fetch custom list details when selected
  - Show custom list info in green box when selected
  - Proper state management for custom list selection
