## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (2025-07-02)

## ‚ùå NOT WORKING

### E-posthistorik (Email History) ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: GroupEmailLog table doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Manual SQL migration created at `/prisma/migrations/manual_add_group_email_log.sql`

### Lokalt Boende Filter ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Solution**: Fully implemented with database field, UI checkbox, and filtering logic

### preferredLanguage Field ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-06-30)
- **Problem**: 500 error "Unknown argument preferredLanguage" when fetching musicians
- **Cause**: Prisma schema had the field but Supabase database was missing the column
- **Solution**: 
  - Created manual SQL migration at `/prisma/migrations/manual_add_preferred_language.sql`
  - Documented sync process in `/docs/PRISMA_SUPABASE_SYNC.md`
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with critical sync instructions

### Accepted Musicians Modal ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-06-30)

- **Improvement**: Redesigned modal to be more compact (removed email/phone)


### Loading States ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Status**: Implemented for instruments dropdown (2025-06-29)
- **Solution**: Added instrumentsLoading state in AddProjectNeedModal
- **Note**: Other loading states may still be missing in the system

### Archive Redirect Issue ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Status**: Fixed (2025-06-29)
- **Solution**: Removed router.push() after archiving
- **Result**: Page stays on musician profile and refreshes data

### Strategy/Quantity Validation ‚úÖ ALREADY SOLVED
- **Status**: Working correctly (verified 2025-06-29)
- **Implementation**: No default strategy, smart quantity handling
- **How it works**:
  - Sequential: Quantity locked to 1 (readonly)
  - Parallel: Dropdown starts at 2 (2-20 available)
  - First come: Flexible (1-20 available)
