# Changelog 2025-06-28

## UI/UX Improvements - Project Needs Table

### Major Layout Redesign
- **Two-row layout**: 
  - Row 1: Information display (status, position, metadata, progress)
  - Row 2: Action buttons and controls
- **Improved information hierarchy**: Users can quickly scan status and progress without action buttons interfering

### Icon and Button Updates
1. **Edit/Delete icons moved**:
   - Now positioned directly next to position names
   - Makes it clear these actions affect the specific position
   - Smaller icon size (w-4 h-4) for subtle presence

2. **Progress bar relocated**:
   - Moved from row 2 to row 1 for immediate visibility
   - Right-aligned with consistent margin (pr-4)
   - Shows completion status at first glance

3. **Action buttons standardized**:
   - All converted to text buttons: "Visa", "Pausa", "Skicka"
   - Consistent sizing (px-3 py-1) across all buttons
   - Right-aligned grouping for easy access

4. **Dynamic expand/collapse icon**:
   - Shows upload cloud icon when no files exist
   - Shows document icon when files are uploaded
   - Centered under metadata bullet point for visual alignment
   - Automatic state detection via API calls

### Spacing and Alignment Fixes
- **Consistent margins**: 16px (1rem) padding maintained on all sides
- **Status badges**: Centered both horizontally and vertically
- **Grid-based layout**: Ensures perfect alignment across all rows
- **Right margin consistency**: Progress indicators and buttons respect box padding

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed "mysterious 0" bug with conditional rendering
- Added file checking system for dynamic icon display
- Improved grid column sizing for better space utilization
- Enhanced tooltip text based on context

### Code Quality
- Updated CLAUDE.md with UI/UX conventions
- Documented common React rendering pitfalls
- Added comprehensive changelog for tracking

## Summary
These changes significantly improve the usability and visual clarity of the project needs table. The two-row layout creates a clear separation between information display and actions, while the standardized buttons and consistent spacing create a more professional appearance.
